Prisma Admin can be used to:

- Query and visually interact with your data
- Modify your data and add new data to your database
- Render your data with custom UI components

Prisma Admin is accessible at the `/_admin` endpoint of your Prisma service: `https://__PRISMA_SERVER__/__SERVICE_NAME/__SERVICE_STAGE__/_admin`

For example:

- `https://eu1.prisma.sh/myuser-539e45/myproject/dev/_admin`
- `http://localhost:4466/_admin`
- `https://myprismaserver.com/_admin`

You can find the [`endpoint`](5cy7#endpoint-optional) of your Prisma service in your `prisma.yml`.

To use Prisma Admin with your own Prisma server, you need to [install the latest beta](https://www.prisma.io/docs/releases-and-maintenance/releases-and-beta-access/installing-the-beta-b5op/#prisma-server-docker).
