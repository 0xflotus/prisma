## FAQ

### What is usage tracking?

We're constantly trying to improve the tools that we build. A key component that helps us achieve better quality in our tools is **usage tracking**.

Usage tracking refers to the collection of anonymized user data ("usage meta data") that provides insights into how our tools are being used, and what problems our users run into.

### What usage metrics are being tracked?

We're currently tracking usage meta data for the following components:

- Prisma CLI
- Prisma server
- Prisma Admin

### How to opt-out of usage tracking?

It is currently not possible to disable usage tracking. However, we are working on this and it will soon be able to opt-out.
